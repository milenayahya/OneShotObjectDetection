One-Shot Object Detection
This project implements state-of-the-art zero, one, and few-shot image-guided object detection using the OWLv2 model. It features a highly flexible, end-to-end pipeline, designed with a variety of user-configurable parameters to cater to diverse use cases.

Key features include:

- Evaluation Code: Evaluate model performance on labeled datasets with comprehensive metrics.
- Visualization Tools: Visualize detection results via TensorBoard.
- Real-time Server Architecture: A scalable TCP/IP-based server for seamless real-time deployment and client interaction.
  
This project aims to offer an adaptable solution for quick and efficient object detection, eliminating the need for data collection and labelling, and model training and finetuning.
